\title{Find missing data in a trajectory table}
\usage{
findMissing(traj, begin = NULL, end = NULL, step = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{traj}{A trajectory data table as produced by the \code{\link{makeTraj}}
function.}

\item{begin}{A full timestamp (date+time) in \code{\link{POSIXct}} format
corresponding to the beginning of the trajectory. If not set, it is set to 
the first timestamp of the trajectory table.}

\item{end}{A full timestamp (date+time) in \code{\link{POSIXct}} format
corresponding to the end of the trajectory. If not set, it is set to the 
last timestamp of the trajectory table.}

\item{step}{A \code{\link{difftime}} object representing the time between two 
consecutive locations of the trajectory. If not set, it is set to the most 
common time difference between successive locations in \code{traj}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 2 columns:
 \itemize{
   \item{"time": }{the missing timestamp.}
   \item{"type": }{"MISSING" if the corresponding observation was not recorded; 
     "NA" if the corresponding observation was replaced by NA during the data
     recording or importing process.}
 }
}
\description{
This function attempts to automatically detect missing data (for 
 instance due to writing errors) in trajectory tables.
