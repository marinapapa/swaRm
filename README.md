## Description

[`swaRm`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/swaRm) is a R package meant to standardize 
and accelerate the processing of data describing the movements of animal and human 
groups (e.g. fish schools, bird flocks). 

[`swaRm`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/swaRm) is a work in progress. Functions 
are not yet in a stable state and are likely to change as the package gets 
developed.
